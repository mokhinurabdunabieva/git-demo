Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?


'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I've been waiting up all night

You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
