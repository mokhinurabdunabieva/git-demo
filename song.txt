Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now low down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I've been waiting up all night

You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want
